    "Equations use the same syntax as in LaTeX.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code cells can contain code of the language the notebook. In this case, we are using the Julia programming language, however notebooks with other programming languages (such as Python) are just as easily created.

    "## Julia\n",

    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can be very fast (comparable to C).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relatively intuitive and simple syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Packages are easy to install and create.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can call code from other languages (ccall, pycall, rcall).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relatively new (since 2012), however recently version 1.0.5 was released (you are using 1.0.4).\n",
    "\n",
    "- This means syntax has changed over time (so old code you find online may no longer work!).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number of available libraries not as large as other languages (eg Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation for Julia can be found here https://docs.julialang.org/en/stable/, with the Introducing Julia wikibook also being highly useful (and more accessible to those newer to programming) https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducing_Julia.\n",
