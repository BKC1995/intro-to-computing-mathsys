    "## What is Python\n",
    "Python is an **interpreted** **high-level** programming language for general-purpose programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**interpreted?** An interpreted programming language is a type of programming language where instructions are not compiled into machine code, instead they are read and executed by another programme.\n",
    "\n",
    "**high-level?** High level programming languages are languages that are close to human readable languages, abstracting away the specific details of the machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python?\n",
    "* Python is quick and easy to programme in\n",
    "* Python is freely available and has lots of free libraries for research and scientific computing\n",
    "* Python can easily interface with other languages\n",
    "* Favoured among the data science and machine learning communities\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Primer\n",
    "Below, we will quickly go through some core programming concepts, highlighting Python specifics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables, Functions, and Types:\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "In Python, there is no need to declare variables before assignment. You simply assign a value to a label using the `=` sign, and that creates your variable. To show output, you can use the `print` function. Make sure you use brackets!"
