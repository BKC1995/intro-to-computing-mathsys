    "# Python for Data Analysis\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to continue with our exposition of scientific computing with Python, particularly looking at data analysis tools in the Scipy stack. We are going to have a brief introduction to two libraries: pandas and scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pandas\n",
    "Pandas - derived from 'panel data' not the cute animal :( - is a library for data analysis and manipulation. If you have used R before, you'd find some of the Pandas constructs very familiar. The main construct in Pandas is the dataframe object, which you can think of as a table where the rows are the observations and the columns are the variables/features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scikit-learn\n",
    "Scikit-learn is a machine learning library in Python. It implements some of the most popular machine learning algorithms as well as useful utilities for preprocessing data and validating models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial\n",
    "This notebook is written as a tutorial on how to do a simple data analysis excercise in Python. We will be using the Boston Housing dataset which contains descriptions of houses in Boston and their corresponding prices. The task is to predict the prices from the descriptions. We start off by loading Numpy and Pandas."

This is due to Anaconda (the software we use to simplify Python library management) updated at regular interval that don't necessarily coincide with package updates. Should this happen, go to your **terminal** and type `pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade sklearn`. This will force anaconda to update the library and dependencies stated.
